###Explanation of the Code

1. **Imports**:
   - The necessary components and functions are imported from `react`, `@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material`, `@toolpad/core`, and `@toolpad/core/internal`.

2. **Theme Creation**:
   - A custom theme is created using `createTheme` from `@mui/material/styles`. This theme includes a color scheme selector and breakpoints for responsive design.

3. **DemoPageContent Component**:
   - This component renders the content for a specific pathname. It uses the `Box` component from Material-UI to create a flexbox layout with centered text.
   - The `Typography` component is used to display the pathname.

4. **PropTypes**:
   - The `propTypes` for `DemoPageContent` ensure that the `pathname` prop is a required string.

5. **DashboardLayoutNavigationLinks Component**:
   - This component sets up the navigation links for the dashboard layout.
   - It uses the `AppProvider` component from `@toolpad/core` to provide the necessary context for the application.
   - The `useDemoRouter` hook is used to set up the router with the initial path set to `/home`.
   - The `DashboardLayout` component is used to render the layout of the dashboard.
   - The `DemoPageContent` component is used to render the content for the current pathname.

6. **PropTypes for DashboardLayoutNavigationLinks**:
   - The `propTypes` for `DashboardLayoutNavigationLinks` ensure that the `window` prop is a function.

### Data Flow and Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `DashboardLayoutNavigationLinks` component initializes the router and sets up the navigation links.
   - The `AppProvider` component provides the necessary context for the application, including the theme and window object.

2. **Routing**:
   - The `useDemoRouter` hook sets up the router with the initial path set to `/home`.
   - The `router` object is passed to the `AppProvider` component to handle navigation.

3. **Rendering**:
   - The `DashboardLayout` component renders the layout of the dashboard.
   - The `DemoPageContent` component renders the content for the current pathname.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - The custom theme includes breakpoints for responsive design, ensuring that the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
